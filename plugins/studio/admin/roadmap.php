/**
 * Studio — feature list and roadmap.
 *
 * What is built, what is coming, and what each gap actually is. Written after
 * a feature-by-feature comparison against Class Manager (classmanager.com),
 * the closest commercial equivalent, so the "coming" half is grounded in what
 * a studio owner will actually ask for rather than guesswork.
 *
 * The list is data, not prose: one array below, rendered. Update the array
 * when something ships — a roadmap that lives in someone's head goes stale in
 * a fortnight, and one that lives in a doc nobody links to goes stale in a
 * month. This one is in the admin nav.
 *
 * Status values:
 *   done    shipped and verified
 *   partial works, but not to the standard the comparison sets
 *   todo    not built; the note says what it means concretely
